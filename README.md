# Renewable Resources Minecraft Datapack

## Overview

Within Minecraft, there's a wide range of blocks and items that have a finite amount within any given world or their renewability is so limited that their renewable method isn't viable. This datapack aims to provide a reasonable means of renewability for these items of the game.

Despite this, there are a handful of items that are still non-renewable. This decision was for these specific items because their rarity is what makes them special or there isn't a good implementation method with datapacks that'd provide a reasonable method to obtain such item.

## Remaining Non-Renewable Items

| Block/Item | Reasoning |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Ancient Debris | The value of ancient debris and netherite is due to their rarity. While blocks of netherite are great building blocks, doesn't feel right to be able to "farm" netherite. |
| Diamonds | From a multiplayer aspect, diamonds are commonly used as currency. So to be able to farm money seems like it'll ruin economies. Besides that, it's kind of the same mindset as netherite, though a lot of the items that require diamonds can be obtained by other means or aren't needed very frequently. |
| Heart of the Sea | Ideally, I'd want this to be a possible trade from the wandering trader. However, there isn't an easy way to add this via datapacks (from what I can find) |
